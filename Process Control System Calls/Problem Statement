Process control system calls: The demonstration of FORK, EXECVE and WAIT system
calls along with zombie and orphan states.
1. Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted.
Main program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child
process. Parent process sorts the integers using sorting algorithm and waits for child
process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any sorting algorithm.
Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.
2. Implement the C program in which main program accepts an integer array. Main
program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process.
Parent process sorts an integer array and passes the sorted array to child process
through the command line arguments of EXECVE system call. The child process
uses EXECVE system call to load new program that uses this sorted array for
performing the binary search to search the particular item in the array.
